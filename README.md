# Projects Repository for Logika v računalništvu
This repository contains folders for two primary tasks from our course:

`sat solver`: This folder contains the implementation of the *DPLL algorithm*.
 The algorithm is implemented in python and demonstrates how to solve propositional logic satisfiability problems efficiently.

`catalan numbers`: This folder includes our Lean project from the practical part of the course. This part is related to proving some properties mostly related to *Catalan numbers*.

## Lean Project Details
The Lean project folder contains solutions to a series of tasks, structured to work within the `mathematics_in_lean` repository. To run the Lean files, ensure that they are located in the appropriate directory within your `mathematics_in_lean` repository.

**The Lean file includes solutions for the following tasks:**

- Small Tasks 1-5.
- Big Tasks 4, 5, 6:
  - Task 4: Completely solved.
  - Task 5: Partially solved.
  - Task 6: Completely solved.
