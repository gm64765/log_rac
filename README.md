# log_rac
Repository for logic in computer science containing 2 smaller projects.

# "Logika v računalništvu" Projects Repository
This repository contains folders for two primary tasks from our course:

sat solver: This folder contains the implementation of the DPLL algorithm.
 The algorithm is implemented in python and demonstrates how to solve propositional logic satisfiability problems efficiently.

Catalan numbers: This folder includes our Lean project from the practical part of the course. This part is related to proving some properties mostly related to Catalan numbers.

# Lean Project Details
The Lean project folder contains solutions to a series of tasks, structured to work within the "mathematics_in_lean" repository. To run the Lean files, ensure that they are located in the appropriate directory within your "mathematics_in_lean" repository.

The Lean file includes solutions for the following tasks:

Small Tasks 1-5.
Big Tasks 4, 5, 6:
Task 4: Completely solved.
Task 5: Partially solved.
Task 6: Completely solved.
This structured approach not only helps in understanding Lean's capabilities but also provides a solid foundation for formalizing and proving mathematical statements using Lean.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects! Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
